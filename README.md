## Course Structure

The course is based on the premise that you can go from a total beginner to a professional programmer in 100 days. I think it's a little out there, but I wont doubt someone could do that if they have the time.
In my experience, between work and university, I'll need a little more time.

The first 14 days is the beginner phase. Covering from:
- Working with variables
- Understand data types
- Logical operations and Control flow
- Loops and Functions
- Lists, Dictionaries and Nesting
- Debugging

From day 15 to day 31 is the intermediate phase, that covers:
- Object Oriented Programmin
- GUIs
- Instances, State and Higher Order Functions
- Files, Directories and Paths
- CSV and Pandas
- List Comprehension
- Errors, Exceptions and JSON Data

Between the days 32 and 60 comes the intermediate+, that have a lot of diferent projects to practice the previous lessons and more knowledge, like:
- smtplib and datetime libraries
- Using APIs
- Web scraping
- Web development with Flask

From the day 61 until the day 80 comes the Advanced part, with projects using:
- Databases and SQLite
- Build an API
- NumPy
- Data exploration and visualisation (matplotlib and Seaborn)
- Linear Regression

After the day 80 and forward there are 20 different professional projects to build a portfolio that varies from Web development to Data Science.
